### Contents

+ `metrics.R` contains several of the functions used to evaluate results
+ `visualize.R` contains an example for visualizing our results

#### Metrics

The `metrics.R` file can be loaded in using the `source` function in R. We include our functions to perform permutation matching and calculate several metrics (root-mean-square-error, Jensen-Shannon divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence).

#### Visualization

The script `visualize.R` is not meant to be run. Please modify and change as necessary to correctly read in results.
